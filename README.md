# SoundWave

A blockchain-powered music and entertainment platform that empowers artists, fans, and creators to connect, monetize, and engage in a decentralized, transparent ecosystem — all on-chain.

## Overview

SoundWave consists of nine main smart contracts that together create a decentralized, artist-centric, and fan-driven music ecosystem:

1. **Artist Token Contract** – Issues and manages artist-specific tokens for fan engagement and rewards.  
2. **NFT Music Contract** – Handles creation, sale, and royalty distribution for music and collectible NFTs.  
3. **Governance DAO Contract** – Enables fans and token holders to vote on platform or artist-related decisions.  
4. **Royalty Split Contract** – Distributes streaming and sales revenue among artists, collaborators, and fans.  
5. **Fan Engagement Rewards Contract** – Rewards fans for activities like streaming, sharing, or attending events.  
6. **Crowdfunding Concert Contract** – Facilitates fan-funded concerts and events with tokenized rewards.  
7. **Dynamic Collectible NFT Contract** – Creates NFTs that evolve with artist milestones or fan interactions.  
8. **Ticket Marketplace Contract** – Manages decentralized ticket sales with anti-scalping measures.  
9. **Oracle Integration Contract** – Connects to off-chain data for streaming stats, event verification, and artist updates.
